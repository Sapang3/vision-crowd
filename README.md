## ⚠️ Problem & ✅ Solution

### Problem
- Mega gatherings like Simhastha often lead to **overcrowding, stampedes, heat stress, and chaotic surges**.  
- Traditional monitoring only reacts **after congestion is visible**, leaving little time for intervention.  

### Solution
- **Vision Crowd** provides a **proactive AI-driven Early Warning System**.  
- It uses multiple indices to assess risks:  
  - **CAI** – Crowd Anxiety Index  
  - **CDI** – Crowd Dynamics Index  
  - **THI** – Temperature-Humidity Index  
  - **TI** – Time Index  
  - **EI** – Event Index  
- The system generates **color-coded alerts** (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) and gives **authorities lead time** to prevent incidents.
